## ðŸŽ¯ About
This is a project based on MERN Stack.I began this project as way to learn about React. It taught me the fundamentals of building a full-stack web application, including user authentication, database management, and frontend development using React. This experience laid the foundation for my journey into web development.

**Front End:**

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

**Backend**

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

**Database**

- [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
